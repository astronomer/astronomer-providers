    Waits for a given partition to show up in Hive table asynchronously.

    .. note::
       HivePartitionSensorAsync uses implya library instead of pyhive.
       The sync version of this sensor uses `pyhive <https://github.com/dropbox/PyHive>`_,
       but `pyhive <https://github.com/dropbox/PyHive>`_ is currently unsupported.

       Since we use `implya <https://github.com/cloudera/impyla>`_ library,
       please set the connection to use the port ``10000`` instead of ``9083``.
       This sensor currently supports ``auth_mechansim='PLAIN'`` only.

       The library version of hive and hadoop in ``Dockerfile`` should match the remote
       cluster where they are running.

    :param table: the table where the partition is present.
    :param partition: The partition clause to wait for. This is passed as
        notation as in "ds='2015-01-01'"
    :param schema: database which needs to be connected in hive. By default it is 'default'
    :param metastore_conn_id: connection string to connect to hive.
    :param polling_interval: The interval in seconds to wait between checks for partition.
