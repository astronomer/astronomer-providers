class HivePartitionSensorAsync(HivePartitionSensor):
    """
    Waits for a given partition to show up in Hive table asynchronously.

    .. note::
       HivePartitionSensorAsync uses impyla library instead of PyHive.
       The sync version of this sensor uses `PyHive <https://github.com/dropbox/PyHive>`.

       Since we use `impyla <https://github.com/cloudera/impyla>`_ library,
       please set the connection to use the port ``10000`` instead of ``9083``.
       For ``auth_mechanism='GSSAPI'`` the ticket renewal happens through command
       ``airflow kerberos`` in
       `worker/trigger <https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/security/kerberos.html>`_.

       You may also need to allow traffic from Airflow worker/Triggerer to the Hive instance, depending on where
       they are running. For example, you might consider adding an entry in the ``etc/hosts`` file present in the
       Airflow worker/Triggerer, which maps the EMR Master node Public IP Address to its Private DNS Name to
       allow the network traffic.

       The library version of hive and hadoop in ``Dockerfile`` should match the remote
       cluster where they are running.

    :param table: the table where the partition is present.
    :param partition: The partition clause to wait for. This is passed as
        notation as in "ds='2015-01-01'"
    :param schema: database which needs to be connected in hive. By default, it is 'default'
    :param metastore_conn_id: connection string to connect to hive.
    :param polling_interval: The interval in seconds to wait between checks for partition.
