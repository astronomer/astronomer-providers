class BigQueryInsertJobOperatorAsync(BigQueryInsertJobOperator, BaseOperator):
    """
    Starts a BigQuery job asynchronously, and returns job id.
    This operator works in the following way:

    - it calculates a unique hash of the job using job's configuration or uuid if ``force_rerun`` is True
    - creates ``job_id`` in form of
        ``[provided_job_id | airflow_{dag_id}_{task_id}_{exec_date}]_{uniqueness_suffix}``
    - submits a BigQuery job using the ``job_id``
    - if job with given id already exists then it tries to reattach to the job if its not done and its
        state is in ``reattach_states``. If the job is done the operator will raise ``AirflowException``.

    Using ``force_rerun`` will submit a new job every time without attaching to already existing ones.

    For job definition see here:

        https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/v2/jobs

    .. seealso::
        For more information on how to use this operator, take a look at the guide:
        :ref:`howto/operator:BigQueryInsertJobOperatorAsync`


    :param configuration: The configuration parameter maps directly to BigQuery's
        configuration field in the job  object. For more details see
        https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/v2/jobs
    :param job_id: The ID of the job. It will be suffixed with hash of job configuration
        unless ``force_rerun`` is True.
        The ID must contain only letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), underscores (_), or
        dashes (-). The maximum length is 1,024 characters. If not provided then uuid will
        be generated.
    :param force_rerun: If True then operator will use hash of uuid as job id suffix
    :param reattach_states: Set of BigQuery job's states in case of which we should reattach
        to the job. Should be other than final states.
    :param project_id: Google Cloud Project where the job is running
    :param location: location the job is running
    :param gcp_conn_id: The connection ID used to connect to Google Cloud.
    :param delegate_to: The account to impersonate using domain-wide delegation of authority,
        if any. For this to work, the service account making the request must have
        domain-wide delegation enabled.
    :param impersonation_chain: Optional service account to impersonate using short-term
        credentials, or chained list of accounts required to get the access_token
        of the last account in the list, which will be impersonated in the request.
        If set as a string, the account must grant the originating account
        the Service Account Token Creator IAM role.
        If set as a sequence, the identities from the list must grant
        Service Account Token Creator IAM role to the directly preceding identity, with first
        account from the list granting this role to the originating account (templated).
