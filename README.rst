`Apache Airflow <https://airflow.apache.org/>`_ Providers containing Deferrable Operators & Sensors from Astronomer.

Installation
------------

Install and update using `pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/getting-started/>`_:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install astronomer-providers


Example Usage
-------------

This repo is structured same as the Apache Airflow's source code, so for example
if you want to import Async operators, you can import it as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    from astronomer.providers.amazon.aws.sensors.s3 import S3KeySensorAsync as S3KeySensor

    waiting_for_s3_key = S3KeySensor(
        task_id="waiting_for_s3_key",
        bucket_key="sample_key.txt",
        wildcard_match=False,
        bucket_name="sample-bucket",
    )

**Example DAGs** for each provider is within the respective provider's folder. For example,
the Kubernetes provider's DAGs are within the
`astronomer/providers/cncf/kubernetes/example_dags <https://github.com/astronomer/astronomer-providers/tree/main/astronomer/providers/cncf/kubernetes/example_dags>`_
folder.

Principle
---------

We will only create Async operators for the "sync-version" of operators that do some level of polling
(take more than a few seconds to complete).

For example, we wonâ€™t create an async Operator for a ``BigQueryCreateEmptyTableOperator`` but will create one
for ``BigQueryInsertJobOperator`` that actually runs queries and can take hours in the worst case for task completion.

Changelog
---------

We follow `Semantic Versioning <https://semver.org/>`_ for releases.

Goals for the project
---------------------

- Our focus is on the speed of iteration and development in this stage of the project and so we want to be able to
  quickly iterate with our community members and customers and cut releases as necessary
- Airflow Providers are separate packages from the core ``apache-airflow`` package and we would like to avoid
  further bloating the Airflow repo
- We want users and the community to be able to easily track features and the roadmap for individual providers
  that we develop
- We would love to see the Airflow community members create, maintain and share their providers to build an Ecosystem
  of Providers.
